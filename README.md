This research project focuses on developing _ICGenius_, a course assistant website initially designed for Computer Science students at Ithaca College. The web application offers access to course-specific materials and features an AI assistant, _BomberBuddy_, that generates responses based on the content uploaded by professors. Additionally, the platform includes a discussion forum where students can engage with Teaching Assistants and Professors.

While there is still significant work to be done before the official launch—such as conducting user testing, designing the professor interface, and incorporating virtual study groups—we are excited to continue advancing this project during our senior year.

This project was supported by **Vanessa Mpofu** and guided by **Dr. John Barr.**
